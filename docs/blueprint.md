## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gradient from Pale lavender (#E6E6FA) to Lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke a soft, feminine, and professional aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light gradient from Lavender (#F5F5FF) to White (#FFFFFF) - almost white but distinctly of the same hue as the primary, to create a subtle backdrop.
- Accent color: Light mauve (#D8BFD8) with a subtle gradient to a lighter mauve (#E1D5E0) to complement the lavender tones and provide visual interest to important interactive elements such as buttons and links.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif for headings, balanced by the neutral 'PT Sans' sans-serif font for body copy.
- Use clean and simple icons, ensuring they align with the soft and feminine aesthetic, and are used sparingly to avoid clutter.
- Design a clean and modern layout with ample white space and clear section divisions for easy navigation and readability.
- Subtle animations, such as fade-ins or smooth transitions, will add a touch of elegance without being distracting.
